## `About hsh`

   According to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), A [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script#:~:text=A%20shell%20script%20is%20a,program%20execution%2C%20and%20printing%20text.) script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.[1] The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

The shell in a general language is a program that serves as the interface for a user to interact with the operating system. It receives input from the user and sends it to the kernel, which makes some requests to the Operating System and returns the output of such operation to the user via the terminal.



There have been several variations of the shell from the time past which includes

  - [The C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell)

  - [The Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)

  - [The Korn Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell)

  - [GNU Bourne-Again-Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

  - and so on.



This version of the simple shell is called `hsh` which simply means `Holberton Shell`. And it's just a replica of the `Unix Shell`. All functions of this version of the shell is expected to be similar to the `Unix Shell`.
